Extremely lightweight and designed to run over Raspberry Pi 3. 

- The RPI3 image is pre-configured to act as ClimbU server, WiFi AP Hotspot and HDMI display output

If you don't have an RPI3, don't worry, it works too on any desktop PC following this environment below:

- A working WiFi network
- A common PC (windows or linux)
- TV/Monitor w/ HDMI
- One or more smartphones (any specs) for the clients.

2. Download [latest portable version](https://github.com/intrd/climbu-livescoring/releases) of climbu-livescoring, unzip at `c:\climbu\`
3. Edit `climbu/climbu-livescoring/config.php` and change `$homehost="192.168.0.100";` to your `LAN IP ADDRESS` (to test on 1st run, change only this variable)
4. Double click at `windows_run.bat` to run and access browsing to `http://192.168.0.100/`, default login/pw: `intrd/meuovo123`

# Administration

To setup your users, and details of competition like categories, sectors and athletes, browse to http://10.10.0.1:81, then point Adminer to `../data/climbu-livescoring.dat`. Not yet created an user-friendly admin interface, you will have to setup directly from the database.

# Setup a advanced development environment (Linux)

System requiriments & dependencies
```
$ sudo apt-get update & apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install php-curl php-cli php-mcrypt php-sqlite3 php-fpm git nginx
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

$ ./runwww.sh #to run climbu locally, acess by browsing http://localhost (its a single thread webserver for development only)
$ ./admindb.sh #to launch Adminer on http://localhost:8000
```
# Translation/Locale problems?

Uncomment a line containing `pt_BR.UTF-8` on `/etc/locale.gen` and then.. 
```
$ sudo locale-gen
```

# Whitelisted ips to use admindb.sh
The whitelist is disabled by default, if you want to enable it to secure Adminer access check `dba/index.php`

# Translations

The default language is `en_US`, but you can translate to any language you want, just follow my `pt_BR` translation file sample.

![pedit](/shots/poedit.jpg?raw=true "poedit")

1. At `langs` directory, clone `pt_BR` to a new directory w/ your language code 
2. Open `default.po` w/ poedit (https://poedit.net/download) and start translating
3. Open `www/config.php` file and change `$language = "en_US.UTF-8";` to your language.
4. Or, if you want multilanguage users, open `database/users` and set the individual user language.
